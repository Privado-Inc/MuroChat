## MuroChat
We're excited to introduce MuroChat â€” an open-source LLM chat application designed for enterprises. 

Our employees wanted to use ChatGPT for tasks like generating code, creating content, writing emails, and other day-to-day tasks. However, we were concerned about the risks involved in terms of protecting our intellectual property and personal data. To address this, we decided to develop our own chat application that would allow us to keep complete control over our data. With this unique approach, sensitive information remained secure within our company, shielding our IP and personal data from potential leaks.

During the development of MuroChat, we realized that many other companies faced similar challenges with their internal chat applications. We recognized that providing an open-source solution would not only address our own concerns but also empower other organizations to bootstrap and develop their secure chat applications. By sharing MuroChat under the permissive MIT license, we welcome developers and enterprises to contribute to its growth and evolution. Together, we can shape the future of secure communication.
